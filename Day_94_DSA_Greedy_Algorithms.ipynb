        "The approach used in this code is to maintain two priority queues, one for the minimum value and another for the maximum value. The code first initializes these two priority queues using the input array C. The priority queues are implemented using a heap data structure from the heapq module in Python.\n",
        "The two priority queues are used to store the current minimum and maximum number of passengers on any bus. The code then iterates over the priority queue of the maximum value until it reaches the number of buses A or there are no more passengers left to distribute. During each iteration, it pops the maximum value from the priority queue, adds it to the maximum answer, and decrements its value by 1 before pushing it back into the priority queue. This process ensures that the maximum number of passengers on any bus is minimized.\n",
        "Similarly, the code iterates over the priority queue of the minimum value until it reaches the number of buses A or there are no more passengers left to distribute. During each iteration, it pops the minimum value from the priority queue, adds it to the minimum answer, and decrements its value by 1 before pushing it back into the priority queue. This process ensures that the minimum number of passengers on any bus is maximized.\n",
        "Finally, the code returns the maximum and minimum answer as a list."
