Now, you want to find the total number of minutes you've been cooking for the sum of your preparation time and the time the lasagna has already spent baking in the oven. The preparation time of one layer is 2 minutes. Given the number of layers added to the lasagna and the number of minutes the lasagna has been baking in the oven, find the total elapsed cooking time (prep + bake) in minutes.\n",
